## Lab 02

### Reflections and Comments
Everything went pretty smoothly. I followed along during the lecture to get the initial scaffolding of the project repo set-up. I also added the HTML structure to the index file and got some of my JavaScript code ready. The instructions for the lab were pretty straight forward. I'm understanding the 'if' / 'else if' statements. I only added a little styling to the HTML. Since the focus of this lab was JavaScript, I made sure I was understanding that concept. I expected this lab to take me an hour and a half to two hours, and it took me a little over two hours.

Added the HTML ordered and unordered lists as requested. Had issues trying to figure out to make the numbers and bullet points appear since we have the CSS reset file. I was on the right track, but a TA was able to help me troubleshoot. It was just that the numbers / bullets were off the page, so I just need to increase the left margin of the `<li>` elements using the CSS style sheet until they appeared. As for the number guessing game, I was also on the right track for that, I just had a variable outside a for loop when it needed to be inside. Also, I need to change a correct guess to a number rather than a string. Also also, I needed to break the loop when they got the correct answer. I thought for sure I would have issues with the 7th question, but, using what I learned from the previous question, I was able to trial and error and got it to work without asking for help. I, for the life of me, couldn't figure out how to count correct answers, so after Googling a lot, asked for help. I thought maybe it had to do with a return statement, but I was totally wrong, BUT I was kind of right about where the code I needed was supposed to go. It was where I was going to put the return statement.
